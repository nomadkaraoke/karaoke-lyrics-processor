        We walk back to the old place
        You check your phone for messages
        And try to make sense of it all
        And if the room is crowded, that's even better
        Because we know we're going to be here until dawn
        But if you're concerned about the weather outside
        Then you chose the wrong venue to spend your evening
        That's how the story begins
        
        
        And so the night unfolds
        You turn the music up loud
        We set our sights on dancing until the morning light
        One of the ways that we show how young we still feel
        And if the dawn breaks, if the dawn breaks early
        If the dawn breaks and I still don't want to go home
        Then it's the wisdom of those who came before us
        That keeps us moving forward
        
        
        You spent the first few years just trying to figure out the rules
        And the next few years trying to reconnect with old friends

        Yeah, I know it gets exhausting, but it's better when we imagine
        
        
        
        It falls apart
        The way it happens in tragic movies
        Except for the moment
        Where the lesson becomes clear
        Though when we're running low on energy
        And the conversations start to fade away
        I wouldn't exchange one foolish choice
        For another decade of ordinary living
        
        
        And to be completely honest
        Oh, this might be our final chance
        So here we venture forth
        Like explorers into the unknown night
        And if I look foolish, if I appear ridiculous
        If I seem absurd on this journey, there's always hope
        And if I'm overwhelmed by the challenges ahead
        I can always return to what matters most
        
        
        
        And with a smile like an old friend and a stance worth laughing at
        You can rest during the journey or think about your words
        When you're tired and the world seems impossibly bright
        You think again and again, "Hey, I've finally found peace"
        Oh, if the adventure and the strategy fall apart in your hands
        You can blame yourself, you silly dreamer
        You'll forget your intentions when you see what you've written
        And yes, we knew you were weary, but still
