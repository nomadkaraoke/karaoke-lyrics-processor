## üîß Processing Features

### Intelligent Line Splitting
The processor uses sophisticated algorithms to find optimal split points:

1. **Comma Priority**: Splits at commas near the middle of long lines
2. **Conjunction Splitting**: Uses "and" as split points when appropriate  
3. **Word Boundaries**: Respects word boundaries and avoids breaking words
4. **Parentheses Awareness**: Handles parenthetical content intelligently
5. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Forces splits when no natural break points exist

### Text Cleaning
- Removes non-printable characters while preserving essential formatting
- Normalizes various Unicode space characters to regular spaces
- Consolidates multiple consecutive newlines
- Strips unnecessary whitespace from line beginnings and ends

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of unsupported file formats
- Recovery from encoding issues
- Protection against infinite processing loops
- Clear error messages for troubleshooting
